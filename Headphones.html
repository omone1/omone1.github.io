            With the holidays just around the corner family and friends are probably asking you the same annoying question. What do you want? I know I deal with this question all the time with my family
            and my answer is usually always the same, I have no idea. In this post I hope to maybe give you some inspiration and finally be able to answer that question with at least one thing. Now I love listening
            to music and while speakers are awesome for parties and hanging out with friends there is nothing better than being able to sit down, put some nice headphones on and get some work done. When it comes to headphones
            I like to keep my options open depending on the occasion so I have a decent amount of pairs. Here is a list of my favorite headphones based on sound quality, comfortness and price. The first pair of
            headphones on this list get a bad rap and many people's first impression of them are not great, the Apple Air Pods. Now I know people think these headphones are a waste of money but in my opinion they are
            the best truly wireless earbud style headphones on the market. The overall design of them is pretty slick and they sit in your ears pretty comfortably. The overall battery life on them is pretty good as for fifteen
            minutes of charging you can get 3 hours worth of listening time and if you keep the charging case on you at all time its basically like they never die. Now onto sound quality, when using both airpods at the same time
            they offer stereo sound that sounds incredible and for earbuds they are pretty good at cancelling out noises around you. They are a little bit pricy sitting at around $160 but in my opinion it is well worth it. The only thing I
            wish these headphones had was a way to control your music from the actual earbuds themselves but other than that these are some of the best earpods available right now. For the next pair of headphones I am going to stay around earbuds.
            The Samsung Gear IconX wirless earbuds are another great addition to the headphone market. Overall the IconX have extremely good sound quality and when it comes to comfortableness they actually are more comfortable then the airpods
            and are very hard to knock out of your ears. The head phones also offer a touchpad on both earbuds that can be used to control your music. For example if you swipe up on the touch pad you can raise your volume
            and of you tap one it pauses your music. These touchpads are super helpful and work in an extrodinary way. The only downside to these headphones is the battery life is not as long as the airpods but I know that Samsung is trying to
            work on that. These headphones are a little bit more expensive than the Airpods at around $200 which is a little expensive but if you want more features out of your headphones then it is worth it. The next pair of headphones
            is a type that is fairly new on the market but are really intresting, Bone conduction headphones. Now when it comes to bone conduction headphones they work really well if you want to listen to music but still be aware of your surroundings.
            In my opinion the best brand for these type of headphones is probably AfterShokz as they have mulitple wired and wireless option with differing price ranges. As to the sound quality of these type of headphones it actually is pretty good considering how
            they work. I have a feeling that the technology for bone conduction is gonna advance a lot in the future and be some of the top headphones on the market. For the last pair of headphones on this list I am gonna go to pick the Bose QuietComfort headset.
            If you are looking to get away from the outside world or trying to focus while doing work these headphones are an oustanding option. These headphones are extremely comfortable and offer a wide array of features. Some of these features include
            noise cancellation as well as being able to connect to you Google Home or Amazon Echo. The battery life on these is extremely long sitting at around 20 hours with a fifteen minute charge giving you 2 and a half more hours.
            These headphones happen to be on the expensive side however costing around $350.This price tag may be high but if you are looking for top notch headphones and aren't afraid of spending money then these definitely should be your go to choice. These are only just
            a few of the headphones that I enjoy, there are obviously way more than just these 4 out there but it is definitely worth looking into these.
