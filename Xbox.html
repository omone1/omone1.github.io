            E3 kicked started off hot yesterday with Microsoft revealing some big things. One of the major things they revealed was their new console named Project Scarlet. Although they
            didn’t give specs of the new console they did state that the main focus is processing power and the ability to decrease loading times and ultimately get rid of loading screens all together.
            Along with this new console some major games were revealed, some fan favorites and others entirely new. Let’s start off with what seems to be a fan favorite, CyberPunk 2077. The conference revealed a cinematic trailer for this
            CD Projekt game. While no gameplay was revealed the cinematic showed what kind of atmosphere the game will entail. In my opinion it came off as a more story driven futuristic grand theft auto. It was also revealed that the one and only
            Keanu Reeves will be in the game. Another game that was revealed  is a new horror game titled Blair Witch. Blair Witch takes place 3 years before the events of the movie in the same woods. This game gives off outlast vibes as it follows a sort of found
            footage style in which the movie made popular. There were a ton of indie and arcade games revealed during this press conference, but one stood out among the rest. 12 minutes is a game that is played from an overhead view with and extremely interesting premise. From the footage shown
            it seems as though you play as a man trapped in a time loop trying to save his wife/girlfriend from a killer. This game caught my eye as it seems each life is played for a short amount of time and every time you reset the time loop the story changes. Games like this are my favorite as they have a high replay
            value and seem like an overall relaxing experience and escape from high stress games. There were more than just new games revealed as a couple of new additions to fan favorites were revealed. Starting with one of the most popular FPS games, Halo. Halo infinite is the next installment in the halo franchise and
            it brings back its titular character, Master Chief. Only a cinematic was shown for this new Halo game but I am hoping that it can make up for last couple of Halo installments. The other game revealed that is a staple franchise of Microsoft and Xbox is the new Gears of War. It was stated during the press conference
            that over the course of the summer more and more of the game will be revealed but the man keynote of yesterday was the new game mode escape. This new game mode will feature players planting a bomb in an enemy base and trying to escape while fighting off swarms of enemies. This game mode is very interesting
            as it reminds me of Call of Duty zombies and looks to be a new leaf for the Gears of War franchise. There were a lot more games featured during this press conference, but these were just a few of the games that I was most interested in and felt that other people would be into as well. For a full list of all the games and other announcements made
