            For my first official article since that long 6 month break I would like to talk about one of my favorite technology shows that is out right now and how its growing popularity is
            leading to its downfall. The show I am talking about is Black Mirror. In the unlikely case that you havent heard of this netflix exclusive, Black Mirror is a show where each episode
            is its own story and completely seperate frome eachother. Each episode usually focuses on a piece of futuristic technology such as insane virtual reality that basically teleports you into a new world
            or an implant that lets parents see everything their child does and even limit what their child can see. Netflix just released season 5 of Black Mirror which consists of 3 hour long episodes that include some very
            familiar faces such as Anthony Mackie and Miley Cyrus. Unfortuantely these famous faces do not make up for the lack luster stories. Now anyone who has seen Black Mirror before knows that the show is best known
            for its shocking twists and overall ability to mislead the viewer only to pull the rug right out from underneath them. Going into the first episode of season 5 I was sitting there waiting for some crazy twist to happen
            but much to my dismay it did not happen and any twist that was presented was easily able to be seen ten minutes before it actually happened. The seccond episode happened to be even worse as not only did it have a
            forgettable story but its twist was something that was so normal and ulitmatley had nothing to do with Black Mirror's theme of technology that it made me chuckle. The only episode that I found somewhat redeeming was the third episode
            in which it gives viewers a unpredicted shock early on in the episode but yet continues to decline as the episode goes on. My overall dissapointment with this season could only be accounted for in my opinion to its growing popularity.
            Between the release of season 4 and the release of season 5 Black Mirror has gained an incredible amount of viewers. This puts a sort of pressure on the writers and creators of the show as like with any show your main goal is to keep and
            gain viewrs at the same time. Unfortuantely without even realizing this leads to the episodes being written with the idea of pandering to fans and trying to make episodes that they think fans will like instead of making episodes that provoke thought that
            causes fans to talk about the show for weeks. With season 6 already confirmed lets hope that Black Mirror decides to touch back to their roots and bring back episodes thta not only show never before seen technology but deliver powerful twists that are the reason why
            so many people love this show.
