            I would like to inform you that as I am writing this article I have only about a month and a half of experience with web development and in no way do I consider
            myself and expert. However I would like to share my thoughts on some things about web development and am if any of you feel the same. The first thing that I noticed while
            learning html and css is how chaotic it is to position objects where you want them on the webpage. Using floats, margins and padding to position an object to be
            at the exact spot of your choosing is too much of a hassle and consists a lot of trial an error. Bootstrap offers a little bit of a better way to organize objects
            but it still is not the best. It would be great if somehow there was a way to say you want the center of this object to be at this x-position and this y-position. This sounds like a good idea
            (at least in my head). One thing I do like however, is how easy it really is to pick up on web development as a whole. It definitely is a good starting language if you are looking into
            getting into programming.
