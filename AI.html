            The first thing people think of when they hear the words artificial Inteligence is robots taking over the world and enslaving humanity. Although
            not completely impossible, it's a far fecthed theory. Artificial Intelligence is on the rise in the buisness world as more and more comapnies are looking to
            increase efficiency and productivity while reducing costs. The capcity for what artficial intelligence could do is unlimited if created correctly.
            All cars and planes could be controlled by AI reducing accidents drastically and cutting the cost of travelling.This could give people the freedom to finally go on those vacations they always dreamed of as the travel fee is usually the most expensive.
            AI can do more than just drive vehicles around for people. They can help regulate buisness and factories and forsee deadly issues that a human eye may not be able to detect before its too late.
            One of the big problems in the medical world is that a lot of the times it takes to long to diagnose a patient and by the time they are diagnosed it is too late.
            Imagine an AI doctor who can scan a patient on the spot and instantly detect what illness, injury or condition they have. This would greatly benefit the the medical world and decrease deaths due to illnesses and
            other injuries. With all the benefits there is some potential downsides to AI. If any of you have seen Avengers: Age of Ultron you will know that the main villian, Ultron is a robot with artificial intelligence
            whose motivation is protecting humankind. Unfortuantely he took this a little overboard and saw the only way to protect the world was to destroy everybody on it who
            he felt was weak. This is actually a real potential problem with AI although not as extreme as seen in the movie. AI's main goal is to complete tasks in the most efficient
            way possible even if this way is not something we forsaw and is potentially dangerous for the user. Right now in its current form AI is pretty basic and is used for very meneal tasks but with time comes innovation and there
            will come a point where AI becomes smarter than the people who created it. This is where people get the whole robots turning on their creators idea and to be honest
            it really isn't as crazy as it sounds. AI definitely has benefits and risks, the question is does one outweigh the other? Is it worth creating something that benefits hummanity and brings us to places we have never been as humans but with the potential that it might one day turn on us and be the end of hummanity?
