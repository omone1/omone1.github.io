             If you were ask what cryptocurrency was two years ago most people would have no idea. It wasn't until Bitcoin's value rose to almost twenty-thousand dollars last year that cryptocurrency was
             thrust into the spotlight for a short period. However, as predicted Bitcoin's bubble burts and the value dropped dramatically and with it the average person's intrest dropped as well. Many people believe
             that cryptocurrency is going to be the currency of the future as it is secure, untraceable and easy to use in an ever growing technological world. As of today there is around  1,700 thousand different versions
             of cryptocurrency with each having a different value and security. The main problem with using cryptocurrency as a main form of currency is technically it dosent exist. Cryptocurrency is literally just lines of
             code on a computer which means there is nothing backing it up which is why the value of cryptocurrencies fluctuate like stocks. This is not something you want for a main currency. Another problem is that people worry about the security
             of cryptocurrency. Most cryptocurrency is extremely secure with a currency called Etherium being the most secure however this does not still mean that it is not impossible to hack into. Even though this is possible it would take someone
             with considerable computer skills to being able to steal cryptocurrency from people and with newly developed block chain technology it is virtually impossible. On top of all this cryptocurrency is unregulated and used mostly
             on the black market and in illegal purchases as it is untraceable. In my opinion while cryptocurrency is convenient, I do no believe thatit is worth totally switching over to and using as a main currency. There are too many risk involved with it as of now so I feel it is much better as a secondary currency put off to the side.
