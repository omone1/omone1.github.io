            I recently wrote an article about the capabilites of smart home technology and what kind of tech you would need to buy in order to automate your home. During my research
            I looked at a lot of products and chose what I thought would be best based on personal experience and usability. For some reason I never came across one of the best smart home gadgets on the market
            to make your alexa and other smart home technology span across your entire house. One Link by First Alert is an oustaanding product that offers safety capabilites for your home while connecting all your devices in your house.
            On the surface it looks like a square speaker that includes a smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector. However it has the capability to connect to your Amazon Echo as well as Apple Home Kit and can extend their range to be home wide.
            The One Link acts like a sub Echo that all connect back to the main one so if your Echo is in the kitchen and you are in your bedroom you can use One Link to talk to it. Now obviously there is high safety capabilities with this as
            the built in fire alarm, carbon monoxide detector and high quality speaker that can ensure that anyone in the home will be able to wake up before its too late. Beyond safety capabilites if you like to entertain guests at your home, if you have one of these in each room
            you will have no issue with music and on top of that there is also built in color changing light to set the mood. I find it fairly suprsing that a product like this hasnt come out before considering the Echo and other products like it have been around
            for awhile. This is the first product that truly makes it available to connect your Amazone Echos and other products house wide.
