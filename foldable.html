            Samsung gave us a first look at their new foldable a couple days ago and too be honest its not that impressive. In all honesty do people really want one of these. As time goes by technology is supposed to be getting more advanced but this just makes it seem like we are going backwards.
            The phone reminds me if they took and old fashion touchscreen flip phone and gave it smart phone capabilities. It also comes with a hefty price tag at $2000 making it one of the most expensive smart phones on the market. Now I am not totally against the idea of a foldable phone, maybe in
            the future they will have better designs and have some advantage to it. However, as of right now it does not look too impressive. It has an annoying crease sitting in the middles of the screen due to the hinge that could be annoying to some people. On top of that when people first thught of a foldable
            phone I imagine they invisioned something thin and lightweight that can fit into your pocket and then fold out into a large screen. That is not the case with this phone, It is about the thickness of a Kindle and overall seems klunky. Hopefully in the future this foldable phone technology will get better
            but for now it definitely does not seem worth the price tag.
