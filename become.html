            When first starting to delve into the world of web developing you may find yourself surfing the web looking at some of the most
            popular websites to try and figure out where to start. This can you make you feel overwhelmed and a little afraid as these websites
            have been around for years and are constantly being worked on. When I first started learning how to become a web developer I did this exact thing
            and it made me feel like it was almost impossible to create a website and have it become popular. Something that everyone needs to realize is that all
            these websites started somewhere and it is no big deal if your website does not look extravegent or futuristic right from the start.
            Just look up Youtube's orginal site or even Facebook, yes they still have a lot going on but those original sites are nothing if you stick to web
            development and put in the time to learn. Some websites that I used when learning were <a href="freecodecamp.org"> Free Code Camp,</a>
            <a href="codecademy.com"> Codecademy</a> and <a href="getmimo.com"> Mimo</a>. Out of these three websites I would highly reccomend Free Code Camp if all you
            are looking for is web development. It contains thousands of hours worth of lessons and cahllenges and they are all free. On top of that Free Code Camp also
            includes forums, chat rooms as well as a way to develop websites for non-profit organizations.If you want to learn more than just web development and learn other programming
            languages then Codecademy and Mimo are they way to go. Codecademy is a free website that has programming tracks with multiple programming languages. It uses an online
            compiler so you can code directly without having to download and install anyhting on your computer. Most of these tracks have fun projects towards the
            end of such as battleship. The only downside to this site is that there is some content that is unavailable unless you uprgade your account and pay.
            The last website that was mentioned above is mimo. Mimo is an intresting one because it dosent involve a lot of coding by typing. Instead, it has a more fill
            in the blank structure. Mimo uses this structure to ask questions or show code where you press buttons to put code into the blanks. The downside to this is
            that you don't actually get to type the code for the most part so you might retain the information as well. One way around this is download a compiler or text editor for the
            language you want to learn and follow along with mimo in that compiler. The upside to Mimo and this style of learning is that they have a mobile app. If you are constantly on the go
            and don't have a lot of time to sit down at your computer and learn then the app version is extremely useful. Mimo is very similar to Codecademy in which they have a large amount of tracks
            and languages with a big project that you work on throughout the track. Some of the more intresting tracks that Mimo offers is game development, app building, becoming a hacker
            and of course web development.
