              It seems that in video games today there is a common theme of microtransactions in order to gain better gear, cosmetic items, etc. These microtransactions have not been taken very well by the videogame community and for very good reasons at that you are paying $60 or more for a game and then you have to pay even more for small extra content such as bonus characters and skins. Why not just include it in some sort of progression system throughout the game where the more you play the more stuff you unlock. Obviously, there are some games like that such as Fortnite with its' battle pass lets you unlock items the more you play but even then, you still have to pay money for the premium battle pass and the free one barely offers you any content. Now obviously Fortnite is free to begin with and the paid items offer no advantage in game besides cosmetic. The problem with microtransactions are when games use them to offer advantages in game that can assist the player making it so called “pay to win”. One example of this is older versions of Call of Duty that offered loot box systems in order to gain cosmetics and guns. You could gain these loot boxes through gameplay, but it was painfully slow and the odds of you getting a gun were extremely low only making it viable to microtransactions to gain these bonus weapons. It is with this type of game that lies the problem with microtransactions when you are paying full price for a game yet have to put in equally the same amount of money you paid the game for just to get bonus content. There are some games that have a very smart way of microtransactions that keeps people who don’t want to spend extra money up to date with new content. One example of this is League of Legends which is a free to play game that allows players to pay extra for cosmetics and characters but also allows them to gain these through gameplay. The gameplay to earn this bonus content is not labor intensive like most games as you gain the in-game currency pretty quickly. I believe that game companies that want to make video games with microtransactions should follow the same type of model as League of Legends. This way it appeases the developers as well as the players but not only having microtransactions but making it easy for the player to acquire these bonus items quickly through gameplay or other things such as challenges or quests. If developers tweak microtransactions I believe they can be good for both developers and players however, in their current state they bring down the quality of games they are included in and are a burden on the gaming community.
