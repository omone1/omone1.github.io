            Imagine being in a world where you could do anything you want. You could be a superhero, travel anywhere in the world, even travel to places out of this world.
            With virtual reality all of that is possible and more as long as your dream it. Believe it or not he first head mounted display used for virtual reality was built in
            1968 but was far too big and imppractical for commercial use. It wasnt until almost 50 years later that virtual reality technology was able to be used for commercial use
            and be ready to change the world. Virtual reality can be used to put the user into basically any situation whether it be playing a war video game, touring through a foreing country or
            rolling down the tracks of a rollercoaster. However, what if we used this immersive technology for more than just entertainment. Imagine someone has an extreme fear of heights, with virtual reality
            they can be put in a situation that can help them get over this dear without actually putting them in danger. Of course this virtual reality in its current form is only visual and auditory but if we could somehow
            simulate the conditions the situation the said person is in it could be much more effective. Virtual reality can contribute a lot more than just medical benefits. Imagine waking up in the moring and going for a hike
            in a lush forest without leaving your house or even having top athletes simulate game situations and use that for training. It even has capabilities to imporve the world of science and egnineering.
            Imagine being able to design a building hands on and see how its looks in real time or test the design of rockets or planes without having to build them. This would decrease costs for companies
            astronmically which in turn could use that money on developing more technology to better the world. Virtual techonology offers a glipmse into the future and with the right ideas can change the world for the better.
